# Housing Data Analysis Project
### This project is a basic data analysis and visualization of a housing dataset. The main objectives are to explore the data, handle missing values, detect outliers, and visualize relationships between different variables.

## Project Overview
###    The project covers:

### Loading and analyzing the dataset
### Handling missing values
### Removing outliers using the IQR method
### Computing the correlation between median_income and median_house_value
### Visualizing data through histograms and scatter plots


## Features
### Identification of missing values in the dataset
### Outlier detection and removal using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
### Visualizing data distributions and relationships using histograms and scatter plots

## How to Use :


### git clone https://github.com/siddhiinirmal26/housing.git
### Open the Google Colab notebook housing_data_analysis.ipynb in Google Colab.

## Install necessary libraries:


### Copy code  ➡️ !pip install pandas, matplotlib ➡️  Run the notebook to explore the data and visualizations.

## Dataset
### The dataset used in this project is a housing dataset that includes columns like:

### longitude
### latitude
### housing_median_age
### total_rooms
### total_bedrooms (with some missing values)
### population
### households
### median_income
### median_house_value
### ocean_proximity

## Acknowledgments
### This project was developed to practice basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.
